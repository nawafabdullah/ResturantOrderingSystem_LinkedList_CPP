1. This program requires a decent knoweldge about "structs" which are used mainly to design the application 
2. I desined the project depending on 2 classes (Orders and Orders_List)
Orders_List: is built by a struct that obtains the menu options from the .txt files
Orders: does all the operations from Assignement1
3. Besides the two classes mentioned above, few pointers have been added to help the flow of the program 
4. I have met all requirments for the assignement except handeling the cases where a wrong choice is 
made by the user after displaying the food menu
5. many test cases have been thrown at the program to test it as it excutes, and the program passed all tests 
except dealing with the dummy node and handeling any choice outside the range of the menu
